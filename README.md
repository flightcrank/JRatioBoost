# 🚀 JRatioBoost

JRatioBoost is now at version 2.0. It is used to spoof uploads to private torrent trackers.
It will simply report to the torrent tracker that you are uploading, when you are really uploading nothing at all.
This will give you a good "ratio" on any private tracker that you use. It will work on any major operating system as long as
Java is installed on that system.

This program has been updated to version 2.0 and is considered complete. It does what it set out to do on every torrent tracker I have tested it on.
I will continue to maintain this program. If there are any issues contact me and ill see if i can solve them
